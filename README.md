# AceContentCreator
Decal Plugin to help with creating content on ACE 

Compile the DLL, Put DLL in a folder, add it to Decal, load client.  Then set your paths to your servers Content Folders, Click save paths.  Will create an acecreator.ini in the same folder as the AceCreator.dll.  When you import a file, it auto populates the WCID so you can create it quickly.  This is initial release, but I have tested it as much as I can.  If there are any bugs, let me know.
If you add more files to your content folders, just click Refresh Files List to update both file lists
